## Description: 
- This project autocompletes words and sentences that the user types
- The program suggests correct spellings on the word being currently typed.
- The program uses AI through Hugging Face API fetching to suggest how to finish the current sentence everytime the user clicks space.
- Pressing tab can autocomplete the word with the top matched spelling and it can also autocomplete the suggested sentence.
- Repeatedly pressing space can generate more sentence completion suggestions.
- Text can be saved to a txt file and then progress can be restored when reopening the program by clicking the retrieve button.
- The press me button plays a fun cat animation.
